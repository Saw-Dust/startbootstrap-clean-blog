<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Museums" tags="" position="265,269">Museums are an amzing place to study mammoths and learn about them. The best traveling exhibit now is the traveling Lyuba exhibit.
&quot;The Museum&#39;s great standing skeleton is Mammuthus , the mammoth. Found in Indiana, this mammoth lived about 11,000 years ago. Mammoths were larger than their relatives the woolly mammoths but lacked their long, coarse hair.&quot; This is a quote from a museum website. There are similar quote like this for different museums in N.A. The Mammoth is are biggest baddest skeleton in N.A. in many cases.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Archeological Finds" tags="" position="883,230">As Permafrost Melts, Chances of Discovering Mammoth Fossils Increase. This is due to the fac that in the last ice age many Mammoths were frozen solid in the ice dead or alive. It is thought that tempuratures decreased so rapidly that some animals were killed immidatly. Others died and were covered in layers of ice and snow. Because of that many of the Mammoths that passed away were very well preserved. Now that the ice in the north is melting people are descovering these frozen mammoths before they decompose further and preserving them. There are also finds all over the world, there was just a Skull found in Chicago for example.

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="North America" tags="" position="239,531">Most populations of the woolly mammoth in North America, as well as all the Columbian mammoths, died out around the time of the last glacial retreat, as part of a mass extinction of megafauna in the Americas. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive. During the long winters there was little food and water for and animal as large as this. In a 2008 genetic study it was seen that some of the woolly mammoths that entered North America did enter through the Bering land bridge from Asia around 300,000 years ago.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Europe" tags="" position="513,433">The Natural History Museum in London has a beautiful display Woolly mammoths. &quot;Mammoths roamed parts of Earth&#39;s northern hemisphere for at least half a million years. They were still in their heyday 20,000 years ago but within 10,000 years they were reduced to isolated populations off the coasts of Siberia and Alaska. By 4,000 years ago they were gone.&quot; They also have a wonderful visual aid to go with this exhibit at, http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/last-mammoths.html</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Partical Finds" tags="" position="695,445">There have been partial Mammot finds popping up all over the world. For example in Michigan a local Farmer found a Mammoth skull when turning up his crop field. Also in Northwestern Oklahoma a bulldozer operator who also discovered a skull. These Skulls seem to be turning up more frequetly in North America but there does not seem to be a reason to why.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Fully Preserved Mammoths" tags="" position="920,510">With the increase of full Mammoth finds there has been a light turned on in the possibility of cloning. There has been an increase of intact mammoths found over the past few years. Yuka and Lyuba are two of these mammoths that have been recently discovered.

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="USA" tags="" position="361,678">There is one of the best Mammoth museumes in the world. This is becasue it is an interactive museum. In South Dakota there are the hot springs, in these hot springs there are hundreds of mammoth skeletons. Many Mamoths over the years of there exsistance got trapped in these springs and they perfectly preserved the bones. They are activley being excavated now. Therefore the coolest part of this museums is that you can actually see these bones being discovered as they are first uncovered. You can actually also reserve a time to help the experts dig this site. This is a great oppritunity for young children and people of any age who are interested in one day becoming anthropologists/archeologists

<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Canada" tags="" position="120,677">Right now the Roayl BC Museum is a wonderful place to go and look at the Mammoth exhibit. They are fortunet enought to have the wonderful Lyuba on display. This is a stop as part of a traveling exhibit. &quot;For the first time ever in Canada, you are able to see Lyuba, a 40,000 year-old baby woolly mammoth. Discovered in Siberia in 2007, Lyuba is the world&#39;s most complete preserved mammoth. This is a remarkable opportunity for visitors to see an animal â€“ now extinct â€“ that once roamed across much of BC.&quot; The community of Victoria is ecstaitic to have such a wonderful exhibit here. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Yuka" tags="" position="893,660">The brain found in a mammoth that has been nicknamed Yuka is the most intact Mammoth brain ever found. This Mammoth was found in the Siberian permafrost. Yuka was inbetween 6-9 when she died. Becasue of level of intaction of this brain and body there has been a new hope in the cloning of an extinct Mammoth.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name=" Lyuba" tags="" position="1070,627">Lyubaâ€™s body was well kept because the Mammoth was buried so quickly after it&#39;s death in fine sediment that sealed it off from the surrounding oxygen. Because of the location of her body was also surounded by acids that were frozen it helped to also preserve some DNA fragments. When the mammoth was alive it would have had a thick coat of brown fur. Its fur fell out during the 42,000 years trapped in ice the bit that remained had turned ginger in the ice.</tw-passagedata>
